        "    - Dispersion refers to the spread or variability of a dataset. It measures how much the data values deviate from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). A higher dispersion means the data points are more spread out, while lower dispersion indicates they are closer together.\n",

        "   - Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of a probability distribution relative to its mean.
